# Dedalus-Sphere

This contains the scripts necessary to run spherical calculations using Dedalus. There are also data which can be found at princeton.edu/~lecoanet/data/dedalus_sphere_data.tgz . This tar file should be extracted in this directory to run some of the data analysis scripts.

## Package installation

The easiest way to install the base sphere scripts is to run "pip3 install -e ." from the cloned directory. This will create an editable installation of the scripts inside "dedalus_sphere" in an importable module called "dedalus_sphere".
